# Legal Disclaimer and Terms of Use

**IMPORTANT: This document is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. You must consult with a qualified legal professional to ensure this disclaimer meets the specific legal needs and compliance requirements of your jurisdiction and practice.**

## 1. Acceptance of Terms
By using the Audio2Note module (hereafter "the Module"), you, the end-user (hereafter "the Caregiver"), agree to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth in this disclaimer. If you do not agree with these terms, you must not use the Module.

## 2. Nature of the Service
The Module is a clinical documentation aid designed to assist healthcare professionals by transcribing audio recordings and generating draft clinical notes and summaries. It is not intended to replace the professional skill, knowledge, and judgment of a licensed caregiver. **The Module is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or medical condition. It is solely a documentation aid and does not provide medical advice or clinical decision support.**

## 3. Acknowledgment of AI Limitations
The Caregiver acknowledges and agrees that the Module utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) models, which are subject to inherent limitations. These limitations include, but are not limited to, the possibility of:
- **Inaccuracies:** The generated text may contain factual errors, omissions, or misinterpretations of the source audio.
- **Hallucinations:** The AI may generate information that was not present in the source audio.
- **Biases:** The output may reflect biases present in the data on which the AI models were trained.

While Sun PC Solutions LLC employs measures to minimize such errors, their complete prevention cannot be guaranteed.

## 4. Caregiver's Responsibility for Review
The Caregiver is solely and exclusively responsible for the clinical accuracy and appropriateness of all patient records. Before finalizing any note, diagnosis, billing code, or treatment plan generated or supplemented by the Module, the Caregiver **must**:
- Thoroughly review all output generated by the Module for accuracy and completeness.
- Edit, correct, or delete any information that is inaccurate, incomplete, or clinically inappropriate.
- Exercise their independent professional medical judgment to ensure the final documentation and any clinical decisions based upon it are correct and in the best interest of the patient.

**All notes generated by the Module are drafts and must be thoroughly reviewed, edited, and finalized by the Caregiver before being used or shared in any clinical or legal context.** The final, signed clinical note is the legal and professional responsibility of the Caregiver.

## 5. Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Sun PC Solutions LLC, its affiliates, officers, employees, and agents shall not be held liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for medical malpractice, personal injury, loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses resulting from:

- Any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions in the content generated by the Module.
- Any clinical decisions or actions taken by the Caregiver based on the output of the Module.

## 6. No Warranty
The Module is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis without any warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. Sun PC Solutions LLC does not warrant that the Module will be error-free or that its output will meet the Caregiver's specific requirements.

## 7. Compliance with Laws and Regulations
The Caregiver is responsible for ensuring that the use of the Module complies with all applicable laws, regulations, and standards, including but not limited to HIPAA, if applicable, and any other requirements governing the handling of patient health information. **The Module is not intended for use in emergency situations, critical care decisions, or any other high-risk clinical scenarios where immediate and accurate decision-making is required.**
