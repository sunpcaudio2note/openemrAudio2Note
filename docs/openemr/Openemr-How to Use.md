# How to Use the Module

After installation of the module:

1.  Open an encounter.
2.  Navigate to `Clinical` --> `Audio2Note`.

    *   **Step 1: Provide Audio**
        *   You have two options for providing audio:
            *   **Option A: Upload a File:** Click "Choose File" to select a pre-recorded audio file from your computer.
            *   **Option B: Record in Real-Time:** Click the red "Record" button to start recording audio directly from your computer's microphone. Your browser will ask for permission to use the microphone. Click "Stop" when you are finished. You can preview the recording using the audio player that appears.

    *   **Step 2: Choose Note Type**
        *   After providing your audio, select the desired note type from the `Note Type` dropdown menu (e.g., SOAP Note, History and Physical).
        *   If you are creating a `Summary` note, no audio is required.

    *   **Step 3: Set Parameters (Optional)**
        *   For transcription accuracy, you can specify the minimum and maximum number of speakers in the audio. For example, if it's only you and the patient, set both to `2`.

3.  Click "Upload and Transcribe" (or "Summarize" for summary notes).

There is no need to wait for the process to finish. You can proceed to your next patient or task in OpenEMR. The note will be populated in the appropriate chart and note form as long as your OpenEMR instance is active.
