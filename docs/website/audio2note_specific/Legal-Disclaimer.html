    <h1>Legal Disclaimer and Terms of Use</h1>
    <p><strong>IMPORTANT: This document is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. You must consult with a qualified legal professional to ensure this disclaimer meets the specific legal needs and compliance requirements of your jurisdiction and practice.</strong></p>
    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By using Audio2Note (hereafter "the Software"), you, the end-user (hereafter "the Caregiver"), agree to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth in this disclaimer. If you do not agree with these terms, you must not use the Software.</p>
    <h2>2. Nature of the Service</h2>
    <p>The Software is a clinical documentation aid designed to assist healthcare professionals by transcribing audio recordings and generating draft clinical notes and summaries. It is not intended to replace the professional skill, knowledge, and judgment of a licensed caregiver. <strong>The Software is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or medical condition. It is solely a documentation aid and does not provide medical advice or clinical decision support.</strong></p>
    <h2>3. Acknowledgment of AI Limitations</h2>
    <p>The Caregiver acknowledges and agrees that the Software utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) models, which are subject to inherent limitations. These limitations include, but are not limited to, the possibility of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Inaccuracies:</strong> The generated text may contain factual errors, omissions, or misinterpretations of the source audio.</li>
        <li><strong>Hallucinations:</strong> The AI may generate information that was not present in the source audio.</li>
        <li><strong>Biases:</strong> The output may reflect biases present in the data on which the AI models were trained.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While Sun PC Solutions LLC employs measures to minimize such errors, their complete prevention cannot be guaranteed.</p>
    <h2>4. Caregiver's Responsibility for Review</h2>
    <p>The Caregiver is solely and exclusively responsible for the clinical accuracy and appropriateness of all patient records. Before finalizing any note, diagnosis, billing code, or treatment plan generated or supplemented by the Software, the Caregiver <strong>must</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Thoroughly review all output generated by the Software for accuracy and completeness.</li>
        <li>Edit, correct, or delete any information that is inaccurate, incomplete, or clinically inappropriate.</li>
        <li>Exercise their independent professional medical judgment to ensure the final documentation and any clinical decisions based upon it are correct and in the best interest of the patient.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>All notes generated by the Software are drafts and must be thoroughly reviewed, edited, and finalized by the Caregiver before being used or shared in any clinical or legal context.</strong> The final, signed clinical note is the legal and professional responsibility of the Caregiver.</p>
    <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>

        <li>Any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions in the content generated by the Software.</li>
