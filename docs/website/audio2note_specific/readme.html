    <h1>Audio2Note</h1>
    <h2>What It Is</h2>
    <p>Audio2Note is a powerful tool for healthcare professionals. It is designed for Internal Medicine and related subspecialties, but its design allows for easy expansion to other specialties in the future.</p>
    <p>This software streamlines the clinical documentation process by allowing you to convert audio recordings from patient encounters into structured clinical notes directly within the patient's chart.</p>
    <h2>What It Does</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Audio to Note:</strong> Upload an audio file of your patient encounter, and the software will automatically generate a custom <strong>Audio2Note SOAP Note</strong> or a <strong>History and Physical Note</strong>, complete with suggested ICD-10, CPT, and E/M codes.</li>
        <li><strong>Chart Summarization:</strong> Quickly get up to speed on a patient by generating a summary of their three most recent clinical notes.</li>
        <li><strong>Seamless Integration:</strong> The generated notes are automatically filed into the correct patient's chart, even if you have moved on to other tasks.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why Use Audio2Note?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Physician-Led Development:</strong> The software is actively used and improved by a practicing physician, ensuring it meets the real-world needs of clinicians.</li>
        <li><strong>Reliable Data:</strong> The Artificial Intelligence models use custom datasets that are produced only from peer-reviewed sources.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy-Focused:</strong> We prioritize the security of your patients' data.
            <ul>
                <li>We use only self-hosted software, including small-scale Artificial Intelligence models (unlike large-scale enterprise models such as Gemini, ChatGPT, and so on). This means that your information does not leave our servers and is not shared with anyone.</li>
                <li>For detailed information on our security practices and HIPAA compliance, please see our <a href="SECURITY.html">SECURITY.html</a> file.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Secure by Design:</strong> All sensitive configuration data, such as API and license keys, are protected with strong, industry-standard encryption (ChaCha20-Poly1305) and stored securely in your database.
            <ul>
                <li>Not only do we use encryption and other methods to protect your information, your Protected Health Information stays on our servers only for the duration it takes to produce the note. It is then securely erased from our servers.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Open and Extensible:</strong> The software is built on open-source software and is designed to be modular, allowing for the easy addition of new features.</li>
        <li><strong>Simple and Powerful:</strong> Record the encounter, then upload the file, and you're done. No need to wait for the process of producing a note to finish â€” just move on to your next patient. The note will be automatically populated in the appropriate chart.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information About Security</h2>
    <p>This document outlines the policies and procedures that Sun PC Solutions LLC has implemented to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Protected Health Information (PHI) in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996.</p>
    <h3>Privacy and Data Handling</h3>
    <p><code>Audio2Note</code> is designed to adhere to the principles of the HIPAA Privacy Rule.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Flow:</strong> When a user uploads an audio file, it is transmitted securely over HTTPS to a designated third-party transcription and note generation service. The polling service then retrieves the text-based data and integrates it into the patient's clinical record. The original audio file is not permanently stored; it is handled as a transient data element for the purpose of processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Minimum Necessary:</strong> The software collects only the PHI required to fulfill its specific purpose. The only PHI disclosed to the external transcription service is the audio recording itself or, in case of note summarization, three previous encounter notes, along with a unique, non-identifying instance ID for licensing purposes. No patient demographic information (name, DOB, etc.) is transmitted.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Security Measures</h3>
    <p>The software's security is built upon a combination of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Transmission Security:</strong> All communication between the software and the external transcription service is conducted over HTTPS, ensuring end-to-end encryption of data in transit.</li>
        <li><strong>Data-at-Rest Encryption:</strong> Sensitive configuration data, specifically the license and API keys, are encrypted at rest in the <code>audio2note_config</code> database table using strong, industry-standard authenticated encryption (ChaCha20-Poly1305). The master encryption key is securely generated and stored in the database, ensuring it is unique to your instance.</li>
        <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> The software is governed by your application's built-in Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. A user's ability to access the software's features is determined by their existing permissions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Audit Controls</h3>
    <p>The system provides a clear and auditable trail for every transaction. The <code>form_audio_to_note</code> table within the database serves as the primary internal audit log, linking every transaction to a specific patient, encounter, and user.</p>
    <h3>Business Associate Agreement (BAA)</h3>
    <p>A formal Business Associate Agreement (BAA) is required with the external transcription service, contractually obligating them to protect PHI in accordance with HIPAA. It is the responsibility of the Covered Entity deploying the software to ensure such an agreement is in place.</p>

    <h4>HIPAA Security Official</h4>
    <p><code>Audio2Note</code> does not designate its own security official. The healthcare organization utilizing the software bears overall responsibility for security, including the software's usage.</p>
    <h4>Incident Response and Breach Notification</h4>
    <p>This section outlines procedures for addressing security incidents, such as health information breaches, in accordance with HIPAA regulations. It delineates responsibilities between the healthcare organization (as the Covered Entity) and the external transcription service (as the Business Associate).</p>
    <h5>Division of Responsibilities</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>External Service (Business Associate):</strong> Pursuant to our Business Associate Agreement (BAA), the external service is obligated to maintain the security of all health information it handles. In the event of a security incident or breach on their end, they must promptly notify the healthcare organization, as per the BA and HIPAA rules.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthcare Organization (Covered Entity):</strong> The healthcare organization is responsible for its own response upon notification of an issue from the external service or discovery of an internal problem. They are ultimately responsible for determining if a breach of unsecured health information has occurred, assessing its scope, and notifying affected individuals, the government, and potentially the media.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Breach Investigation and Notification Process</h5>
    <p>Should the external service report a security incident, the healthcare organization's HIPAA Security Official will initiate an investigation. <code>Audio2Note</code> assists by providing records to identify all affected individuals.</p>
    <p>The investigation typically involves these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Information Gathering from External Service:</strong> The external service will provide details regarding the incident, including its timing and any unique identifiers for the affected data.</li>
        <li><strong>Internal Record Review:</strong> The healthcare organization's technical staff will examine the <code>form_audio_to_note</code> table in the database. This table serves as the primary record linking each transaction to a specific patient.</li>
        <li><strong>Identification of Affected Individuals:</strong> Utilizing the identifiers provided by the external service, the healthcare organization can ascertain which patients' information was involved.</li>
        <li><strong>Response and Notification:</strong> With the list of affected patients, the healthcare organization can then fulfill its obligations under the Breach Notification Rule.</li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Proactive Incident Detection</h5>
    <p>In addition to responding to issues reported by the external service, the healthcare organization can also proactively monitor for potential security concerns. The software regularly communicates with the external service. Errors logged by this softwareâ€”such as connectivity failures, anomalous responses, or persistent job processing issuesâ€”may indicate a security event at the external service and warrant investigation by the healthcare organization's HIPAA Security Official.</p>
    <h4>Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)</h4>
    <p>Sun PC Solutions LLC may, in the future, need to expand for additional computational resources. In such cases, a formal Business Associate Agreement (BAA) will be executed with any entity that handles health information. This agreement legally obligates them to protect the health information they process. It also outlines their responsibilities in the event of a security incident or breach, ensuring compliance with HIPAA rules. The healthcare organization utilizing the software is responsible for ensuring this agreement is in place.</p>
    <h4>Training Policy</h4>
    <p>All personnel within a healthcare organization utilizing <code>Audio2Note</code> who have access to health information must undergo regular HIPAA training. This training encompasses fundamental HIPAA regulations, the organization's specific policies, and proper, secure usage of <code>Audio2Note</code>. Training will be provided upon hiring and annually thereafter, or more frequently if regulations or procedures change.</p>
    <h4>Training Records</h4>
    <p>The healthcare organization is required to maintain records of all HIPAA training completed by its staff. These records must document the training dates, content covered, and attendees. Such records must be retained for a minimum of six years and made available to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) upon request.</p>
    <h4>Sanctions Policy</h4>
    <p>The healthcare organization must establish and enforce appropriate penalties for staff members who fail to comply with its HIPAA policies or this documentation. The severity of the penalty will be commensurate with the violation and may range from warnings and additional training to employment termination and legal action, in accordance with the organization's policies.</p>
    <h4>Record Retention</h4>
    <p>Sun PC Solutions LLC, and any healthcare organization utilizing <code>Audio2Note</code>, must retain all HIPAA-related documents for a minimum of six years from their creation date or last effective date. This includes, but is not limited to, policies, risk analyses, agreements, training records, and incident reports. All records will be maintained in a secure and readily accessible manner.</p>
