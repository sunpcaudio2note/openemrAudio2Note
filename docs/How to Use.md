# How to Use the Module

After installation of the module:

1.  Open an encounter.
2.  Navigate to `Clinical` --> `Audio2Note`.

    *   **For History and Physical or SOAP notes:**
        *   Choose your audio file.
        *   Select the `Note Type`.
        *   Specify the number of speakers in the audio file:
            *   If it's only you and the patient, set `Min Speakers = 2` and `Max Speakers = 2`.
            *   If it's you, the patient, and a family member, set `Min Speakers = 2` and `Max Speakers = 3`.

    *   **For Summary notes:**
        *   Choose `Summary` from the `Note Type` menu.

3.  Click "Upload and Transcribe".

There is no need to wait for the process to finish. You can proceed to your next patient or task in OpenEMR. The note will be populated in the appropriate chart and note form as long as your OpenEMR instance is active.
